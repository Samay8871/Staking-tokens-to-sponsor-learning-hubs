Staking Tokens to Sponsor Learning Hubs (STSLH)

## Project Description
The Learning Hub Staking Platform is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables community members to stake tokens in support of educational learning hubs. The platform creates a sustainable funding mechanism where token holders can become sponsors of specific learning hubs while participating in the growth of educational initiatives.

The smart contract system allows hub owners to create and manage learning hubs, while stakeholders can contribute by staking their tokens to support these educational ventures. The platform includes features for secure token staking, hub management, and transparent tracking of all sponsorships.

2. Create transparent and accountable relationships between sponsors and learning hubs
3. Build a self-sustaining ecosystem that incentivizes long-term support for educational projects
4. Foster community involvement in educational development
5. Enable direct support from token holders to educational initiatives
